# Bonsai Marketplace ðŸŒ³

This was a MVP I made to help design a marketplace where people could buy and sell Bonsai trees. Even though I'm a fullstack developer, I am baised towards the UI/UX aspect of things. Understanding users and how to make it so that the tech adapts to their needs than it being the other way round really interests me to work on projects such as these.
